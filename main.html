      <h1>The NA Miata!</h1>

      <p class="opening-statement">
        So, you have decided to get the NA version of the Miata, great choice!
        However, there are gonna be pros and cons that you need to take note of
        when owning and buying this car. You can get the NA paired with either a manual transmission or an
        automatic transmission! This car is not that fast and it makes up for it
        by being fun to drive (especially with the top down) and the 50/50
        weight ratio of the car makes the car's handling very smooth and some
        say it makes you feel more connected to the car. And if after
        considering all of the pros and cons of the car and you bought it, I
        suggest you try it on a curvy road and have fun with it! :)

          <h3>NA (1997) Specifications</h3>
          <p class="NA-note">
            Note: The production year of the car spans from
            1989-1997, however, I am only recommending the 1997 model year so
            that it would have a lot of features, including passenger airbags
            which the 1989-1993 model years didn't have
          </p>
          <ul class="NA-feature-list">
            <li>
              It comes with 1.8L engine with 4 inline cylinders rather than the
              1.6L engine
            </li>
            <li>
              It has a combined MPG of 22 MPG and takes Regular Unleaded gas
              with a 12.7 Gal tank capacity
            </li>
            <li>
              It has a 133 Horsepower @ 6,500 RPM with a 114 lb-ft of torque @
              5,500 RPM
            </li>
            <li>
              It is a rear wheel drive car and comes with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed
              automatic
            </li>

          <h3>NA Pros:</h3>
          <ul class="NA-pros-list">
            <li>
              It is a very agile car because of it's 50/50 weight distribution
            </li>
            <li>It is very easy to take care of basic maintenance</li>
            <li>
              It can be a very inexpensive car to buy depending on the condition
              and the money that you are willing to spend on an old car.
            </li>
            <li>
              The car has a lot of aftermarket support for parts and you can
              basically modify it to your liking!
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>NA Cons:</h3>
          <ul class="NA-cons-list">
            <li>
              The car is very prone to rusting (especially if you live somewhere
              that snows).
            </li>
            <li>
              The paint isn't that good and I would recommend to clear coat it
              and wrap with PPF (Paint Protection Film)
            </li>
            <li>
              You are very low to the ground and larger vehicles wouldn't be
              able to see you always, so you would need to drive even more
              carefully.
            </li>
            <li>
              The car is very old and finding one with a lower mileage can be
              pretty expensive!
            </li>

            <h3>How to take care of your NA Miata!</h3>
            <ul class="NA-feature-list">
                <li>Stay on top of basic maintenance schedule!</li>
                <li>Hand wash it if you can and dry it with a towel</li>
                <li>Clear coat the paint so that your paint looks even more beautiful and can even protect it; wrap with PPF to protect it from rock chips</li>
                <li>If you do have minor rust, take care of it if it's still possible</li>
                <li>Drive carefully and get a dashcam because other drivers will have a difficult time seeing you in their blindspot!</li>
